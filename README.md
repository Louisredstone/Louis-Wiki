# Obsidian Louis' Wiki Plugin

This is Louis' Wiki plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

## Features

- Create a new wiki entry.
- Allow you to choose a folder to create the new wiki entry in.

## TODO List

- If you created a new folder in WikiFolder, it should be automatically added to WikiLibrary.folders. (Now the plugin just refresh WikiLibrary.folders every time you create a new entry.)
